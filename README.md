# PacMen-
## Description
A Pacman on demand is created by a click to the button "Add Pacman". With each click a Pacman appears on the screen at a random position. 
A "Start Game" button makes the Pacmen move at random velocities as soon as it is clicked. 
Once a Pacman hits on of the edges of the screen it changes its direction.
